		<p class="hike-p">Over the years I've become very fond of the outdoors and becoming active while taking in all of the sights that Mother Nature has to offer.  With that, a personal goal was set for hiking New England Hundred Highest peaks with an elevation of more than 4000 feet.  The challenge is organized and run by the Appalachian Mountain Club.</p>
